# student-matching

## Setup

From the project root (any Python 3.12+; there are no runtime dependencies):

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The editable install puts `utsu_core`, `utsu_std` and `utsu_mail` on the import path, so every `python -m ...` command
below works from any directory. Relative paths in flags and `config.json` (`data/`, `secrets/`, `testing/`,
`templates/`) are always taken from the project root, never from the working directory.

## Testing mode

```
python -m utsu_core.main --testing
```

This first generates the fake data (the generators are in `testing/`), then runs the whole pipeline on it. The fake
roster and form exports (`fake_uoft_data.csv`, `fake_senator.csv`, `fake_sabp.csv`, `fake_agm.csv`) are written to
`testing/output/` along with a fresh database, the log, and the results (`verified.csv`, `unverified.csv`,
`seats.csv`, `unseated.csv`, `seating_run.json`). That folder is gitignored and rebuilt every run; the generators are
seeded, so the data is the same each time. The pipeline uses the seats in `data/seats_senate.csv`. `config.json` is
not read or changed, and flags such as `--seed` or `--seats_file` still override the defaults.

`python testing/generate_fake_data.py` regenerates just the fake data, with other settings if you want: the student
roster (from the seats file) first, then the Senate, SABP and AGM form exports, each drawing its applicants from the
roster. Use `--only` to pick some, `--students` to set the roster size (it must be at least `--sabp-rows`), and
`--help` for the seed and row counts. The shared code lives in that file; the per-form logic is in
`testing/generate_fake_*.py`.

## Student Aid Bursary Program (SABP)

`utsu_core/sap.py` processes the SABP form export (Stages 1-3 of SAS-002). From `src/`:

```
python -m utsu_core.main --program sap --sap_file path/to/export.csv [--batch_size 50]
```

(`--testing` supplies `testing/output/fake_sabp.csv`.) Column names come from `data/conversion_table_sap.csv`; columns not
listed there are ignored. For each student only the newest application is kept, then it:

- **verifies** name + truncated student number against `uoft_data`, and records one `student_aid` row per application
  (deterministic `uuid`, matching `student_uuid`, stream, requested amount, WFNI, flags, batch/record). Reprocessing
  updates those rows but never overwrites `awarded_amount` or `decision`;
- **scores** the Weighted Financial Need Index for living-costs applications from the policy weights, and adds review
  flags (`membership_not_confirmed`, `amount_over_max`, `instant_approval_eligible`, `high_wfni`, `no_statement`, ...);
- **writes** to `<output_dir>`: `sap_verified.csv` / `sap_unverified.csv` (private: names, ID, email),
  `sap_run.json`, and `sap_batches/batch_NNN.csv` + `.txt`: anonymized batches of at most 50 applications, oldest
  first, with the general statement, requested amount, WFNI and blank `need_level` / `notes` columns for reviewers.
  Names, emails, phone numbers, student numbers, postal codes and links are redacted from statements; the
  committee-facing files carry only the application `uuid` and a record id like `B001-07`. Faculty is left out.

**Two reviewers per batch.** Pass `--reviewers "Ann,Bo,Cy"` (two or more names; testing mode uses `Reviewer_A,B,C`).
Each batch is assigned to two of them, the least loaded first, and saved in `sap_batch_reviewer`, so existing batches
keep their reviewers when more are added. Each reviewer gets their own copy in
`sap_batches/by_reviewer/<name>/batch_NNN.csv` (and `.txt` to read): they fill in `need_level` (0-5) and `notes` and
return the file to the same place. Reprocessing never overwrites a reviewer's sheet; if a batch has changed since it was
issued (e.g. the last, partial batch grew) a warning says so and merging reports the missing ratings.

Once the sheets are filled in, merge them:

```
python -m utsu_core.main --program sap --merge_reviews
```

This writes `sap_merged_ratings.csv` (and the `sap_review` table): per application the reviewers, each rating, the mean,
the spread, a `suggested_amount` (the mean of the rubric maximums, capped at the amount requested) and a `status`:
`agreed`, `discuss` (levels differ by 2 or more), `incomplete` (one rating) or `unrated`. Invalid levels and unknown
applications are logged as warnings.

## AGM voter RSVPs

`utsu_core/agm.py` processes the AGM voter RSVP export. From `src/`:

```
python -m utsu_core.main --program agm --agm_file "path/to/RSVP.csv"
```

(`--testing` supplies `testing/output/fake_agm.csv`; `python testing/generate_fake_data.py --only agm` regenerates it.) Columns come from
`data/conversion_table_agm.csv`. Each person's newest RSVP is kept, then verified against `uoft_data`:

- the form has **no student number**, so people are matched on their ACORN-registered name (`name_only_match` flag). A
  name shared by several students stays unverified (`name shared by N students`) until the form adds a
  `Student Number` column, which is then used automatically (`name + student number`);
- every RSVP gets an `agm_rsvp` row (uuid, matching `student_uuid`, status, reason, flags; no names or emails);
- `<output_dir>` gets **two attendee lists**, sorted by last name with a blank `checked_in` column for the door:
  `agm_list_all.csv` (every verified attendee) and `agm_list_in_person.csv` (those whose Meeting Preference says
  "in person"; anything else, including a blank answer, is left off), plus `agm_unverified.csv` (with the reason),
  `agm_accommodations.csv` (dietary and accessibility needs of verified attendees, by uuid only, no names) and
  `agm_run.json` (counts by meeting preference, match method and flag). The lists carry names and emails: keep them private.

**Verification on its own.** The verification lives in `utsu_core/agm_verify.py` and can be run without producing any
lists or database rows, to check an RSVP export against a database that already holds `uoft_data`:

```
python -m utsu_core.agm_verify --agm_file "path/to/RSVP.csv" --db path/to/db.sqlite [--output_dir DIR]
python -m utsu_core.agm_verify --testing     # testing/output/fake_agm.csv against the last `main --testing` database
```

It writes `agm_verification.csv` (status, reason, match method and flags per person).

## Emailing (`utsu_mail`)

Mail-merge emails sent directly over SMTP:

```
python -m utsu_mail --list_fields                 # templates + columns from src/schema/*.sql
python -m utsu_mail senate_verified --dry_run     # render a preview, never connects to SMTP
python -m utsu_mail senate_verified               # preview, confirm, send
```

**Templates** live in `templates/email/`. `<name>.txt` starts with a `Subject: ...` line, a blank line, then the
plain-text body; an optional `<name>.html` is added as the HTML version (values are HTML-escaped). Placeholders are
`{{ field }}`. To change an email, edit the file; to add one, drop in a new `.txt`.

**Recipients** come from a CSV (default `<output_dir>/verified.csv`, or `--recipients`) or a read-only
`--query "SELECT ... FROM uoft_data ..."` against `--db`; each column is a field, so alias columns to match a template.
Templates are checked against the recipient columns before anything is sent, and the error points at the schema table
that has a missing field. Rows with a bad/duplicate address or a blank field a template needs are skipped and listed.

**SMTP** settings go in the `smtp` section of `config.json` (`host`, `from_addr`, and optionally `port`, `security`
= `starttls`|`ssl`|`none`, `username`, `from_name`, `reply_to`, `delay`). The password is never read from config: set
`UTSU_SMTP_PASSWORD` or you will be prompted.

**Safety:** a sample is shown first; type `send` to confirm (`t` mails the sample to the sender address only, `r` shows
another sample). Every outcome is appended to `<output_dir>/mail_log_<template>.csv`, and addresses already sent are
skipped on rerun unless `--resend` is given.

Tests: `python -m pytest` (the `pythonpath` and test folder are set in `pyproject.toml`).
